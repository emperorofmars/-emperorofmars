= Working on STF
:hardbreaks-option:

STF is a work-in-progress **modular 3D interchange format** for games-development use-cases.

**https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf_documentation**

I'm frustrated with the lack of interoperability for 3D assets, especially in open source.
STF is my attempt to develop an open and extensible alternative to FBX.
This doesn't replace glTF or USD, these formats exist for different use-cases.

Aside from that, I make 3d Avatars for VR applications like VRChat and VSeeFace.

# Hi, I'm Mars
I make 3d Avatars for VR applications like VRChat and VSeeFace as a hobby.\
Find all my links at [Squirrelbite.com](https://squirrelbite.com).

I'm frustrated with the lack of interoperability for 3D assets, especially in open source.\
FBX is the current best 3D interchange format. Sadly, it is non-extensible and undocumented, hardly optimal.\
View my pinned repositories for my attempts to do something about that!

Cheers!

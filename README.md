# Hello There, I'm Mars

I make 3d Avatars for VR applications like VRChat and VSeeFace as a hobby.\
You can view them on [Gumroad](https://emperorofmars.gumroad.com/) and [Itch](https://emperorofmars.itch.io/).

The single relevant format for VR & V-Tubing avatars is a `.unitypackage` that contains a scene with a setup somewhere.\
There is no interoperability for avatars. And it is severely lacking for 3d models by themselves.\
Using those avatars as an end-user is prohibitively difficult as it requires the use of a Game-Engine like Unity.

I'm trying to improve that, by creating a prototype/proof of concept of an extensible file format for 3d models.\
You can view my progress in the [STF - Scene Transfer Format Repository](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity)

# Hello There, I'm Mars
I make 3d Avatars for VR applications like VRChat and VSeeFace as a hobby.\

# STF | Extensible 3d Asset Interchange Format
The single relevant format for VR & V-Tubing avatars is a `.unitypackage` that contains a scene with a setup somewhere.

There is no interoperability for avatars. And the least horrible format for 3d models is unfortunately `fbx`.\
Using those avatars as an end-user is prohibitively difficult as it requires the use of a Game-Engine like Unity.

With the STF project, I'm trying to create an easily extensible interchange format for 3d models.\
STF should be able to easily host an extension for application agnostic & fully featured VR & V-Tubing avatars.

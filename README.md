# Hello There, I'm Mars

I make 3d Avatars for VR applications like VRChat and VSeeFace as a hobby.\
You can view them on [Gumroad](https://emperorofmars.gumroad.com/) and [Itch](https://emperorofmars.itch.io/).

The process of creating avatars, and using them as an end user, is rather frustrating.\
I'm trying to improve that, by creating a prototype/poc extensible file format for 3d models called STF.\
You can view my progress in the [STF Repository](https://github.com/emperorofmars/stf-unity)

All other links can be found at [mars.squirrel.pub](mars.squirrel.pub).
